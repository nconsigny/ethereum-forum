# Ethereum Forum Project - Cursor Rules

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo with two main components:

- `/web` - pnpm + Vite + React frontend project
- `/app` - Cargo + Rust backend project

## Package Management & Tooling

- **Frontend**: Always use `pnpm` commands, never `npm` or `npx`
- **Linting**: Run `pnpm lint:fix` to resolve frontend linting issues
- **OpenAPI**: This project uses autogenerated types from OpenAPI specifications

## Styling & CSS

- **Framework**: Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
- **Features**: Nested CSS and CSS custom properties (CSS vars)
- **Config**: Check `tailwindcss.config.js` and `index.css` for styling setup details

## Code Organization

- **React Components**: Keep components clean and focused
- **Utilities**: Move reusable functions to `util` or `lib` folders instead of defining them inline in components
- **Example**: Functions like `toFirstLetterUppercase` should be extracted to utility modules in the util folder, not embedded in React components

## Development Guidelines

- Prefer extracting utility functions over inline definitions in React components
- Use the established folder structure for better code organization
- Always use pnpm for package management operations in the frontend
